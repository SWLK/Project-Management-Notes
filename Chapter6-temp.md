# Quick overview of chapter 6

## Project Schedule Management

**Project schedule management** involves the processes required to ensure timely completion of a project.

Six main processes are involved in project schedule management:
+ Planning schedule management
    + involves determining the policies, procedures and documentation that will be used for planning, executing, and controlling the project schedule
+ Defining activities
    + invovles identifying the specific activities that the project team members and stakeholders must perform to produce the project deliverables
    + An activity or task is an element of work normally found on the work breakdown structure (WBS) that has expected duration, cost, and resource requirememnts
+ Sequencing activities
    + involves identifying and documenting the relationships between project activities.
    + requirements, a resource breakdown structure, and project documents updates
+ Estimating activity durations
    + involves estimating the number of work periods that are needed to complete individual activities
+ Developing the schedule
    + involves analyzing activity sequences, resource requirements, and activity duration estimates to create the project schedule.
+ Controlling the schedule
    + involves controlling and managing changes to the project oschedule

### Planning Schedule Management

The first step in project schedule management is planning how the schedule will be managed throughout the life of the project.

> The project charter often mentions planned project start and end dates, which serve as the starting points for a more detailed schedule.

After reviewing the:
+ project management plan
+ project charter
+ enterprise environmental factors
+ organizational process assets

the team uses:
+ expert judgment
+ analytical techniques
+ meetings

to develop the schedule management plan.

> The schedule management plan, like the scope management plan, can be informal and broad or formal and detailed, based on the needs of the project.

A schedule management plan includes the following information:
+ Project schedule model development
    + Many projects include a schedule model, which contains project activities with estimated durations, dependencies, and other planning information that can be used to produce a project schedule.
+ Level of accuracy and units of measure
    + Discusses how accurate schedule estimates should be and determines whether time is measured in hours, days, or another unit.
+ Control thresholds
    + Variance thresholds, such as +/- 10 percent, are established for monitoring schedule performance.
+ Rules of performance measurement
    + specifies how to determine the percentage of work completed
+ Reporting formats
    + describes the format and frequency of schedule reports required for the project
+ Process descriptions
    + how all of the schedule management processes will be performed

### Defining Activities

Defining activities involves identifying the specific actions that will produce the project deliverables in enough detail to determine resource and schedule estimates.

Outputs of this process include:
+ activity list
    + a tabulation of activities to be included on a project schedule
    + the list should include activity name, identifier or number, and a brief description
+ activity attributes
    + provide schedule-related information about each activity
    + predecessors, successors, logical relationships, leads and lags...
+ milestone list
    A **milestone** on a project is a significant event that normally has no duration.
+ change requests
+ project management plan updates
