##### Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs

Abraham Maslow argued that humans possess unique qualities that enable them to make independent choices, thus giving them control of their destiny.

+ Maslow developed a hierarchy of needs which states that people's behaviors are guided or motivated by a sequence of needs

From low to high priority:

1. Physiological
  + Food
  + Water
2. Safety
  + Physical safety
  + Economic security
3. Social
  + Acceptance
  + Love
  + Affection
  + Association with a team/group
4. Esteem
  + Recognition
  + Prestige
  + Status
5. Self-Actualization

> A satisfied need is no longer a motivator

He distinguished between:

+ Motivational factors:
  + Produces job satisfaction
    + Achievement
    + Recognition
    + The work itself
    + Responsibility
    + Advancement and growth
+ Hygiene factors:
  + Cause dissatisfaction if not present, but do not motivate workers to do more
    + Larger salaries
    + more supervision
    + more attractive work environment

Hygiene Factors | Motivators
---|---
Larger salaries | Achievement
More supervision | Recognition
More attractive work environment | Work itself
Computer or other required equipment | Responsibility
Health benefits | Advancement
Training | Growth

#### McClelland's Acquired-Needs Theory

Specific needs are acquired or learned over time and shpaed by life experiences, including:

+ Achievement (nAch):
  + achievers like challenging projects with achievable goals and lots of feedback
+ Affiliation (nAff):
  + people with high nAff desire harmonious relationships and need to feel accepted by others, so managers should try to create a cooperative work environment for them
+ Power (nPow):
  + people with a need for power desire either personal power (not good) or institutional power (good for the organization)
  + provide institutional power seekers with management opportunities
